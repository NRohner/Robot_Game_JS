    Data Types:
    undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, object

    undefined - something that is undefined (duh). You have not assigned a variable type to this yet
    null - Nothing. This is deifferent from undefined. You literally define the variable as nothing
    symbol - immutable prymative value that is unique
    object - can store key value pairs

    Some of thi^^ wont make sense right now but we will get to that later in the course.

    'var' is the key word to create a variable

    let ourName = "freeCodeCamp";    // 'let' - only used within the scope of where you declare it

    const pi = 3.14;                 // 'const' - A constant. This variable can never change

    var a;                          // just initializing a variable but not assigning anything to it so it is undefined
    var b = 2;                       // this is assignment. The equals sign is our assignment operator
