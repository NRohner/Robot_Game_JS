                <p>This is Clint. He is a robot. You can control Clint's arms using the left and right arrow keys.</p>
                <p>Use the spacebar to pick up green packages. To do this, you will need to position Clint's grabber close to the top of the package.</p>
                <p>Press spacebar again to release the package. The goal is to place each package on top of its red drop zone.</p>
                <p>Try to pick and place as many packages as you can!</p>
